To Aylin, the love of my life,<br>
The love that once felt so out of sight,<br>
The love that was already so near<br>
Cause my other half was right here<br>
<br>
To the love that feels so swimmingly easy<br>
The love that makes me feel so cheesy<br>
The one who holds me together when I fall<br>
When nothing makes sense at all<br>
<br>
Through rough and fun, through wrong and right<br>
You are always there, my light<br>
My other half, my favorite part of me<br>
The missing part that was always meant to be<br>
<br>
From raging in Roblox chats<br>
To grinding Overwatch stats<br>
From two hearts in love today<br>
To husband and wife someday<br>
<br>
One day I will make you mine<br>
And promise to keep you until the end of time<br>
To the most perfect person I know<br>
I love you more than I'll ever be able to show</span>
